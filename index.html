            <p>Since the start of the pandemic, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has become one of the most popular games of 2020.</p>
            <p>I moved back home in the middle of March and about a month later in April I bought this game. It's as addictive as reviews say,</p> 
            <p>and I spent most of this self-quarantine playing it until school started again in September. With the virtual element of the game,</p>
            <p>I was also allowed to play with my friends, who I couldn't see in person because of COVID.</p>

            <p>The only other video game I have is Minecraft, which I got my brother and I for his birthday in June.</p>
            <p>He loves Minecraft and the idea was when I move out we can play with each other on there.</p>
            <p> Minecraft has also kept him busy during the pandemic, since he wasn't allowed to go to camp over</p>
            <p>the summer or see any of his friends either.</p>
